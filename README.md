#GNU/Linux for Android devices
##GNU/Linux | Android | Convergence

The target of this project is to create a convergence between the desktop and the mobile/phablet... so to build new mobile OS based on existing GNU/Linux distributions with the most common parts possible.

This repository include :
- Android build integration
- Android OTA zip file creation per distribution
- Distributions packaging (not yet available upstream) to build a GNU/Linux system with Android Hardware/software support
- Documentation about architecture, device portage, build instruction, ...

##Documentation
