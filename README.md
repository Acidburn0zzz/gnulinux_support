GNU/Linux | Android | Convergence
=================================

This project is a global repository with all resources needed to build a GNU/Linux based on Android HW

For now the focus is on Archlinux but "every" GNU/Linux distribution can join the effort.

GNU/Linux distribution needs support for :
- ARM architecture
- systemd
- Qt 5.6
- plasma 5.6

This is in an EARLY stage
